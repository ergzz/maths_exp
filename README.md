# maths_exp
experimental maths project

This code is meant to be used for the experimental maths project of Summer Semester 2020.

The goal of the project is to determine if a knight, starting from a point (x,y),  can reach another point (x',y') on an arbitrary rectangle chess board with (a,b) moves.

We also want the knight to perform as few moves as possible. 

Finally, we'd like to visualize the moves of the knight.

BFS versions : uses Breadth-First search to find shortest path (version with a regular knight + version with arbitrary (a,b)-knight).

DFS versions : uses Depth-First search to find out if coordinates reachable or not (version with a regular knight + version with arbitrary (a,b)-knight).

Visualisation: create animated SVG files then convert them online as .gif images.
