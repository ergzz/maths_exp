# maths_exp
experimental maths project

This code is meant to be used for the experimental maths project of Summer Semester 2020.

The goal of the project is to determine if a knight, starting from a point (x,y),  can reach another point (x',y') on an arbitrary chess board (starting with a n*n board) with (a,b) moves (not necessarily (1,2)).

We also want the knight to perform as few moves as possible. 

Finally, we'd like to visualize the moves of the knight.

In this algorithm, we're using a backtracking approach, derived from the problem of the knight tour.
